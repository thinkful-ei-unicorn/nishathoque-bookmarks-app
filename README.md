##User Story

You can add bookmarks to the bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
   
    - Title
   
    - Url link
   
    - Description
   
    - Rating (1-5)
   
    - A list of my bookmarks when the app is first opened

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
You can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
You can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

You receive appropriate feedback when you cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
You can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
